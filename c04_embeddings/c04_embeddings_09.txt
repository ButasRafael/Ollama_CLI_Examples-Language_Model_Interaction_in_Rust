in to postulate that the laws of physics, including the speed of light, are the same for all observers, no matter their state of motion.

Despite this, two objects can spread apart at a rate greater than the speed of light because this rate is not the same as the speed of light in a vacuum. When we talk about two objects moving apart, we are referring to their relative velocity. If two objects are moving in opposite directions, each at a speed close to the speed of light relative to a third ob
