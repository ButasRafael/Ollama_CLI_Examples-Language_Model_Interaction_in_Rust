server, their separation rate can exceed the speed of light. This does not violate relativity because no single object is traveling faster than light in any given reference frame; instead, it is the sum of their velocities that appears to exceed light speed.

Moreover, in the context of the expanding universe, galaxies can move apart from each other faster than the speed of light due to the expansion of space itself. This is not due to the motion of the galaxies through space but rather becaus
